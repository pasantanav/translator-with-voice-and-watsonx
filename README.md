# Project about creating a voice translation assistant using watsonx and IBM Watson Speech Libraries for Embed that can:
- Take voice input.
- Convert it to text using speech-to-text technology.
- Send the text to watsonx's flan-ul2 model.
- Receive a response in other languages.
- Convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology.
- Play it back to the user.

The voice translator will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a reliable back-end using Flask.
